        I am the Thanksgiving Turkey. When I was young, I lived in the land of North America with my family of turkeys. One day, when I was collecting the fall leaves to hang up in my bedroom, a man threw a bag over my head and took me away. Next thing I knew I was sitting with some family at their table.
