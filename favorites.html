  <p>From the alternative genre, one of my favorite bands is the Cranberries! They have such amazing songs featured
    in movies and shows such as Derry Girls. I would say that "Linger" is one of their best and most popular songs, and 
    definitely deserves the attention it gets.<br />

  <p>Metal is the most extreme genre there is out there and is always best when listening to it on full blast.
     "Enter Sandman" is an easy listen compared to other metal songs, but it is definitely one of the best.<br />

  <p>I personally don't listen to much pop music, but I do have some preferences. 
    Although most of their music is considered as "noise music", Stray Kids still count as a pop group (although they should not be) so here 
    is "Rock" by Stray Kids.<br />
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HHZrmKlm4Jo?si=gdtRnNz7YrclMOqV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </p>

  <p>When it comes to R&B, there is nothing to say but "Waterfalls" by TLC is so beautiful.<br />
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8WEtxJ4-sh4?si=Ub-U6L3zV5crDFTx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </p>

  <p>I am sure that </p>

  <p>Rock is probably one of my favorite genres so it is so difficult to choose just one song.
